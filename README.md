# HandPoseDetection
Deep Learning project to detect hand poses in pictures

Helper tools for building the dataset:
- `labeler.py` for labeling the images and creating the heatmaps for the fingertips
- `rename.py` for making the image names consistent
- `separator.py` takes the original dataset folder containing synth folders and separates images from jsons
- `simple-augment.py` augments the images to have a larger dataset
